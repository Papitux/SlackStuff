Console Help

The in-game console (default key: tab) can be used both for chat and system commands, although there won't necessarily be anybody to chat with for a while.

Copy paste is supported and you can use the up and down arrows to scroll through history. Additionally you can press tab again within the console with a partial command written to get full suggested command options.

Chat

To send chat messages simply open the console and write anything that doesn't start with a /.

Commands

First a few quick notes:

    All commands must be prefixed with a single slash character: /.
    Parameters should be spaced apart with no commas needed. Strings should still be in double quotes.
    Block and shape names are not case sensitive, in most cases you do not have to specify the module either.
    To list all available commands type /help.

In following some commands are explained in more detail. You may find module specific commands explained on the module's page.

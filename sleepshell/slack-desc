# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

sleepshell: SleepShell (Dummy Shell)
sleepshell:
sleepshell: This is a simple  do-nothing,  sleep-forever  program that can be used
sleepshell: as a login shell  (in Linux or Unix)  to keep the  connection open but
sleepshell: without interactive shell.  We use it to create SSH accounts for users
sleepshell: who will only use them for SSH-tunneling to create an encrypted tunnel
sleepshell: to  our  servers  (for example to connect securely to database servers
sleepshell: like mySQL, PostgreSQL, etc).

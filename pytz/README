pytz (World timezone definitions for Python)

pytz brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows
accurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4
or higher.  It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end
of  daylight saving  time,  which you  can read  more about in the
Python Library Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).
